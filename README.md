# Leaflet-Challenge
For this project I have examined USGS provided data from the Earthquakes Hazards Program which shares live feed of global earth quake occurences within a specified time period. For the purpose of this project we will be viewing the live feed of all earthquake occurences within the past month (30 days).
## The Challenge
The challenge is to leverage leaflet js plug in with html to display the map along with visual indicators of important factors concerning the earthquake event such as the location, radius of impact, and depth in kilometers.
Each of these factors have their own visual representation and the details can be reviewed via a pop up which is activated by right clicking on each of the various markers on the map.
## The Visual Indicators
### Location
The location of the occurence is vividly indicated by a circular marker indicated on the map using the geographical coordinates of the occurence provided from the live feed detail.
### Magnitude
Likewise the area impacted can be examined by the radius of the circle marker itself which is predetermined from the magnitude value also provided from the live feed detail.
### Depth
The various colors of the circle markers represent the depth of the earthquake occurence the relationship between depth(km) and color gradient can be interpreted by examining the legend displayed in the top right corner of the map.
## The Map
Use the zoom feature located in the top left corner of the map to examine the location more closely and to identify region level details such as country, state, city of the surrounding the earthquake occurance.
